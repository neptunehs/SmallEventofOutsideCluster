A linear event pack mod,with 6 events and 1 anomaly,but without any new models.So it's small.
All events happened in newly generate outside clusters or systems.

Warning:My mother language is Chinese,so this mod use google translate to make English localization,and quality is low.

events£º
1.surround-galaxy highway
2.Grand seal
3.Hexagram Cluster
4.Invasion of Krah'en Empire
5.Phantom Fleets
6.Corrupted Weapons

anomaly:
1.War of Heaven(Primitive)

Note:
1.This mod has easy mode and default mode,you can change it in policies before first event begin,or auto turn to easy mode if you don't use NSC(newshipclasses) mod.
2.May suffer performance in late-game(like L-gate events,all outside cluster will do).
3.This mod may conflict to any mod changing game_rules/can_win_timed_victory,can_enter_system_by_jump,can_take_hostile_actions,can_jump_drive,I will compet every mod using this as I know.And may conflict to any mod generate outside clusters or orphan systems like Extragalactic Clusters.(But compet MEM)
4.I never try it in multiplayer game,may cause unknown problems.
5.Of course,No achievements support.
