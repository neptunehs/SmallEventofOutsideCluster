 nep_phantom.3001.desc:0 "The galaxies on the border suddenly came with information about the remnants of the Kahn Empire. But we can't capture them. The military officers think this is fake news. However, domestic news has been reported greatly, and some border galaxies have experienced small-scale panic."

 nep_phantom.3003.desc:0 "After enough research on the existence of [event_target:nep_phantom_global.GetName], we determined that they are in the uncertain phase, just like a certain planet in the universe. What we have to do is to fix them. But fixing a whole fleet (calling them like this for the time being) is much more difficult than fixing a planet. Scientists have come up with basic ideas and need more research."

 nep_phantom.3005.name:0 "Old place"
 nep_phantom.3005.desc:0 "Our scientists found out where the existence of [event_target:nep_phantom_global.GetName] came from. Perhaps everyone will not be surprised: they are from the center of the universe, and they don't look like a static third seal. The third sub-print seems to transmit all incoming presences in an unidentified way (they immediately transition at the speed we can't detect at the end of the transfer, so we can't lock it before), and the origin looks quite distant— ——— But we felt a very weak energy response similar to Baoyu from that direction. The brave probe group conducted a biotransmission test on the third sub-seal under the code of [event_target:nep_phantom_global.GetName], confirming that even if someone's fleet is transmitting, it has no effect; but if the transmission is a large fleet, it looks like It will lead to a period of inability to use. If there are enemies on the opposite side, the fleet may need to defend itself against the enemy. "

At the moment we took off the jade, all the [event_target:nep_phantom_global.GetName] of the whole universe disappeared, it seems that this is the fictitious. Although we can never know the cause and effect of this incident, we solved them and found Baoyu. Scientists have also found from the data sent back by the detectors that our fleet can temporarily enter the phase to avoid enemy attacks, and if it is practical, it may bring some usefulness. "

They are anchored at [From.GetName] and it is not clear what they want to do. Our military tried various ways to intercept it, but Our attacks are completely ineffective and don't accept any communication. They seem to be looming, just like the instability, and some even think that this is the ghost of the Kahn empire to revenge - of course, this is impossible.

All major hospitals are overcrowded, and not only our citizens, but all animals and plants have experienced varying degrees of weakness.
