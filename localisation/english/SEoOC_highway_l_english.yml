 nep_highway.22.desc:0 "Our sensors accidentally found some strange shadows on §Y[ROOT.FROM.GetName]§! where led in §Y[ROOT.FROM.Solar_System.GetName]§!.The scientists believe that this should be a small ruin left by the §Y[ROOT.FROM.Solar_System.GetName]§! prehistoric civilization,and after the initial exploration,they believe that the ruin is very intact and worth for further exploration."

 nep_highway.23.desc:0 "We found traces of people who have lived in these small ruins. At present, it is initially judged that these are some building in a living area: in other words, the possibility of digging out good things is not so good."
 nep_highway.23.desc.cybrex:0 "We found traces of mechanical work in small ruins. It is currently preliminary to judge whether this is a factory or some similar facility. In other words: the possibility of digging out good things is not so good."
 nep_highway.24.desc:0 "We basically explored the entire ruins. Sure enough, this is just a living area --- or an apartment complex. We barely found anything of value --- only some note of their normal life. Although these materials are very good that they aren't erased by time, there is no valuable information on them. It may be used to study the lives of these ancient people, but it has no other effect. There are still some rooms left to be fully explored, but please don't expect too much."
 nep_highway.24.desc.cybrex:0 "We basically explored the entire ruins. This is a production dispatching station that is used to allocate resources -- but no resources are left. We barely found anything of value -- the only thing left is the notes stored in memory. Although these storages are very good that they aren't erased by time, there is no valuable information on them. Maybe it can be used to study how these ancient robots work, but it has no other effect. There are still some rooms left to be fully explored, but please don't expect too much."
 nep_highway.3.desc:0 "We found some weird information: some of the notes that should be a location with other coordinate system, and words like "highway" "station" near it. Now we need to find information on the methods of deciphering these coordinate systems."
 nep_highway.3.a:0 "Organize relevant information."
 nep_highway.4.desc:0 "We have found a way to decipher these coordinate systems on notes, and then we found that the location it pointed to was not recorded by our intel. After observation, we really found an undetected system at that location -- but it has no hyperlane connections. If we want to go in, §Y we need jump drives§!."
 nep_highway.4.a:0 "Interesting. Maybe we should find a way to go in."
 nep_highway.4.b:0 "We have wasted enough time! Go for other meaningful work!"
