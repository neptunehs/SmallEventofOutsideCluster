 nep_seal.2.name:0 "Dangerous Roadblock"
 nep_seal.2.desc:0 "In [From.GetName] our ship almost hit a pile of wrecks that don't know where to come. After the analysis of the age, this is the wreckage left by ancient times. Maybe we should analyze whether there is something valuable inside? At least, we have to do the cleanup - the end of the roadblock itself reveals that this pile of things must be cleared."
 nep_seal.2.a:0 "Let the scientists do the "cleanup" work, I believe they can do better." 
 nep_seal.2.b:0 "Let the cleanup team set off, although it will cost a few energy credit..." 
 
 nep_seal.3.name:0 ""Cleanup" Complete"
 nep_seal.3.desc:0 "The scientists' "cleaning up" work at [From.GetName] is complete. We found the black box inside, and after analysis, it uncovered the secret of why this stuff would become a pile of cosmic garbage. It seems that the ship was attacked here -- not knowing who the attacker is -- and then failed to make an emergency FTL. After analyzing the reasons for the FTL failure, our scientists learned that the entire highway was easy to fail because of unclear reasons. (We shouldn't choose to be a battlefield here at any time.) And next,we found a white, unidentified orb in the wreckage. Our instruments felt a strange, directed energy response in this orb. We can't do a destructive analysis -- there is no tool can cut off this orb. "
 nep_seal.3.a:0 "Being attacked? Whose attack? Ancient wars? Or is it related to this orb? " 
 
 nep_seal.4.name:0 "Murphy's Law is always correct"
 nep_seal.4.desc:0 "There are two reports: First: Scientists have discovered that the unbreakable orb suddenly had a serious energy response. Scientists believe that this reaction points to the center of the galaxy, but we have no way to go there -- this thing makes scientists disappointed -- and scientists have decided to freeze the study. Then the second report:the sudden emergence of an unknown number of unidentified fleets on the highway, began to attack the passing ships -- almost happened at the same time of those energy response with the orb, and should be considered relevant - the number of fleets is a horror, it is recommended to prepare for the battle. ""
 nep_seal.4.a:0 "Forget the orb for now -- Battlestation!" 
 
 nep_seal.5.name:0 "End of battle"
 nep_seal.5.desc:0 "The war on the growth of unidentified forces is over.After analyzing a large number of samples, the scientists have figured out a lot of things:first of all, these forces seem to be the ancient guardian of the highway. Second, the other role of these highways is to seal something. These fleets are designed to protect the seal from damage. Then it may be because the maintenance fee is insufficient, and it is used as a highway to earn maintenance fees. This is also why this highway is so... round. What is specifically sealed, and the relationship with the previous orb, we will continue to study."
 nep_seal.5.a:0 "Very funny. Establish special project research. " 
 nep_seal.5.b:0 "I don't want to see this kind of war again. Throw the orb into the black hole." 
 
 nep_seal.6.name:0 "Study Completed"
 nep_seal.6.desc:0 "After we conducted a comprehensive study of the guardians of the highway and the orb, we finally learned where the seal is -- the galaxy center. There are several singular points near the galaxy center. It was called §YStep to the void§! by the ancients. It can be used as a transit point for jump and galaxy center can be reached through several jump. However, the information left in all guardians is emphasized - §R The seal is very dangerous, never open! §!"
 nep_seal.6.a:0 "The science team will go immediately! " 
 nep_seal.6.b:0 "It sounds really dangerous. Forget it, the life of the people is more important. " 
 
 nep_seal.7.name:0 "The Seal"
 nep_seal.7.desc:0 "As scientists have inferred over the years, the galaxy center is really a large black hole -- bigger than any known. In addition, there are two "small" black holes around it -- although it is actually very large -- to maintain balance in an unidentified way. The place where the orb's energy point to is a position next to the big black hole--let the scientists go and see? "
 nep_seal.7.a:0 "Go ahead." 
 nep_seal.7.b:0 "It's a wonder of the universe. But I don't want to continue anymore. "

 nep_seal.8.name:0 "Ancient Altar"
 nep_seal.8.desc:0 "The orb point to an altar in the universe, which leaves the information of the ancients - the § Y two orbs §! and § Y Dragon §! sacrifices here, you can open the seal. Inside is the seal are §Y finalweapons §!, but once it is out of control, the entire Galaxy is finished. They regrets the invention of this finalweapon, but once the Galaxy has a crisis, this ultimate weapon may still be useful, so seal it in the big seal. --- But we did not find the relevant information of the Galaxy Highway. Maybe it is not the ancient people of the same era who made this seal and made the highway?"
 nep_seal.8.a:0 "Finalweapon? Attractive." 
 
 nep_seal.9.name:0 "Sealed Evil"
 nep_seal.9.desc:0 "We put the orb up, and then there was a strong energy response immediately on the seal, and the "thing" which coming out didn't respond to any of our message. Maybe we have another battle."
 nep_seal.9.a:0 "This evil feeling is not like the "finalweapon", nor the guardian of them. No matter what, battlestation!"
